    new_string = ""
    for char in string:
        if char in vowels:
            new_string += "S"
        else:
            new_string += char
    return new_string

  
test_string = "python"
new_string = replace_vowels_with_s(test_string)
print(new_string)

OUTPUT:
Pythsn

FROM employees
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

9.use diffrent operators in SQL

2,Comparison Operators
3,Logical Operators
4,String Operators :
        SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM table1;
        SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 LIKE '%value%';

10.What are scalar functions and write a query

Scalar functions are a type of function in SQL that take a single input value and return a single output value. They are commonly used to perform calculations or transformations on individual values within a query

Here is an example query that uses a scalar function to convert a temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
SELECT temperature, (temperature * 1.8) + 32 AS fahrenheit
FROM temperature_table;
